# Markdown Previewer

### A tool for previewing markdown language.

This was a React app created for the Front End Libraries Certification for freeCodeCamp.  
It was very useful learning about markdown syntax for the sake of writing all these READMEs.  
I used one stateful class component as the container for the two functional components.

You can try the app [here](https://markdown-tool.netlify.com/).
